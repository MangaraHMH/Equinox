                <h1>Air Purifier Buyer's Guide</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Air purifiers are handily portable devices that combine the power of an internal filter (though, there
                are air purifier models without filters as well) with a fan to remove unwanted particles from the air in
                a designated room. The freshly purified air is then circulated back into the room. An air purifier can
                eliminate pollutants like wildfire smoke, pet dander, dust, pollen, and other toxins in the air of a
                specific room. Air purifiers are the opposite of an oil diffuser or humidifier, in that they remove
                particles from the indoor air instead of adding particles to the air. In fact, the Environmental
                Protection Agency reports that particular pollutants can be anywhere from 2-5 times more concentrated
                indoors than outdoors. So, an air purifier is clearly a worthwhile investment. </p>
            <p>In this guide, we review the different filter types built into air purifiers, as well as air purifiers
                that operate without filters and cutting-edge technology to sanitize the air. We also cover the particle
                removal process carried out by air purifiers, the different target pollutants of an air purifier, and
                the coverage, dimensions, and features of air purifiers. </p>

                <h2>Filter Type</h2>
            </div>
            <p>There are a wide array of air filters available for purchase. We’ll cover HEPA, True HEPA, charcoal, and
                filter-free alternatives, and what particular particulates each kind of filter is specifically designed
                to eliminate from the air. From there, you’ll be able to invest confidently in exactly what kind of air
                purifier you need to best address your air purification needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HEPA Filter: The HEPA filter is commonly known as the most reliable filter. The HEPA filter is
                    paired with an activated carbon filter, and it's extremely effective at catching a wide array of
                    particulates that can be found within your home. The particulates that HEPA targets include dust,
                    pollen, mold, bacteria, and any other airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns. The difference
                    between a True HEPA filtration device or filter and a normal HEPA filter is that the True HEPA
                    filter specifically conforms to the DOE standard for HEPA filtration, is the most efficient, and is
                    able to hit the required 99.97% threshold (the threshold for particulates captured).</li>
                <li>Charcoal Filter: Charcoal (or carbon) filters specifically remove odors, fumes, smoke, and other
                    chemicals. Examples of these can include the gases in cigarette smoke or those that are given off by
                    drying paint or cleaning products. Benzene, toluene, xylene, and some chlorinated compounds are
                    additional examples of chemicals that can be removed by a carbon filter. </li>
                <li>Filter-Free Alternatives: A filter-free air purifier is able to deploy a stream of ions that are
                    negatively charged in order to eliminate pollutants and contaminants in the air such as allergens,
                    that most often consist of positively charged ions. There are also air sanitizers that are able to
                    sterilize the air by using heat or UV light in order to eliminate viruses, bacteria, and spores.
                </li>

                <h2>Particle Removal</h2>
            </div>
            <p>A HEPA filter, which is most commonly used by air purifiers, can theoretically capture and eliminate
                at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any other airborne particles that have a size
                of .3 microns. You should note that the specification of .3 microns represents the worst case.
                Particles that are bigger are trapped by the filter with even greater efficiency. Charcoal or
                activated carbon filters are able to remove pollutants from the air through a process known as
                adsorption. It’s key to note that this is completely different from “absorption” when a substance
                that you want to remove is actually absorbed into the structure of the absorbent. An example of this
                would be a sponge and water, and how the water itself doesn’t become chemically bonded to the
                sponge. Charcoal (or activated carbon) filters absorb the pollutants in the structure of the filter
                itself. The activation process for an activated carbon filter is crucial because the surface area
                gives gases a greater area to stick to. Over time you will need to replace the charcoal (activated
                carbon) filter because gaseous pollutants will eventually entirely fill up the adsorption sites of
                the actual carbon. </p>
            <p>Lastly, filter-free air purifiers like air ionizers are able to use two plates that are each
                electrically charged, and then work together to thoroughly sanitize the air. One plate will charge
                the molecules flowing in and exiting the purifier. The electrical field that's in the actual air
                purifier charges all the molecules and lastly releases the newly sanitized air back into the
                enclosed area. The other most commonly used filter-free air purifier is an ultraviolet purifier. An
                ultraviolet purifier can kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and mold spores. Ultraviolet air purifiers
                are extremely effective and cost-efficient, using little electricity when operating. </p>

                <h2>Target</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Air purifiers that have HEPA filters can effectively capture numerous harmful particles that you can find
                indoors like pollen, pet dander, dust, viruses, and wildfire smoke. For starters, COVID particles are
                generally estimated to range between 0.06 to 0.14 microns, which is a size that HEPA filters have been
                shown to be effective in capturing. However, the EPA states that an air purifier with a HEPA filter
                doesn’t guarantee that you can’t still get sick after exposure to a virus. But, the air purifier will be
                highly effective in helping you and any other people in your household stay healthy. </p>
            <p>Next, wildfire smoke is measured to range between 0.1 to 0.7 microns. When wildfire smoke is inhaled it
                can result in numerous health problems. These health problems include a burning sensation in the eyes,
                bronchitis, asthma attacks, and more dangerous conditions like a heart attack and stroke. The EPA
                additionally reports that wildfire smoke which is often made up of vegetation, natural fuels, and
                synthetic materials, has been attributed to causing premature death and difficulty in breathing for
                children. The great news is that HEPA filters are very effective at removing smoke. The EPA recommends
                air purifiers as being an effective tool to eliminate smoke. </p>
            <p>Air purifiers are also extremely effective in capturing the microscopic flakes of skin and/or dander that
                your pets can shed around your home. Pet dander can range from 0.5 to 100 microns, and while consistent
                sweeping and vacuuming can be helpful in negating the unwanted effects of exposure to pet dander like
                intense eye-watering, an itchy throat, and even respiratory problems, an air purifier is much more
                thorough in its cleaning process. Next, air purifiers that are equipped with HEPA filters can
                effectively capture dust particles. When left unaddressed, dust can lead to serious health conditions if
                it’s inhaled deep within your lungs. Not only will an air purifier with a HEPA filter capture dust
                particles, but it can also capture dust mites, which are far too small for your eyes to pick up
                otherwise. Lastly, an air purifier with a HEPA filter is highly effective at capturing pollen. Pollen
                measures out to between 10-100 microns. If you’re someone who suffers from pollen-related allergies, an
                air purifier can thus significantly enhance your daily life. </p>

                <h2>Home Placement</h2>
            </div>
            <p>It’s best to set up your air purifier so that it’s as close as possible to the source of the odors and/or
                potential allergens. Some example spots where your air purifier will perform at its best include: close
                to your dog/cat’s bed, in the kitchen close to the stove, and in any rooms that contain a lot of fabric
                or other materials that often gather a lot of dust. </p>
            <p>Additionally, make sure to give your air purifier at least 6 inches of space away from any walls, doors,
                or furniture. You want to maximize the amount of airflow that the air purifier can generate with its
                intake fan. You also need to keep your air purifier away from other potential sources of heat to ensure
                that your air purifier doesn’t overheat from all the work that it gets done. Lastly, work to put your
                air purifier in a dry space that isn’t susceptible to excessive moisture exposure.</p>

            <p>You’ll want to make sure that you invest in an air purifier that is sized relative to the size of the
                room that you plan on setting it up in. Simply use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of
                your room in feet. Then, multiply those two numbers to get the square footage of the room where you’re
                going to put your new air purifier. You can then calculate the volume of air in your room by taking the
                square footage of your room (in ft) and multiplying it by the ceiling height of the room (in ft). </p>
            <p>As an example, consider the following: You have a 600 sq ft room with an 8 ft ceiling height. The total
                air volume of the room is 600 sq ft x 8 ft = 4,800 cubic feet. If you want an air purifier that will
                change all the air in the 600 sq ft room 2 times per hour, the air purifier will have to provide 9,600
                cubic feet of cleaned air.</p>
            <p>Your target range in terms of how many air changes per hour (ACH) your air purifier provides should fall
                within the 2-5 air change range. Anything within this range ensures that your air purifier is cleaning
                the air every 12-30 minutes. Additionally, if you live in a home with pets and/or smokers, you should
                aim for a maximum of 5 changes per hour. This will vastly cut down on the total number of allergens in
                your home. </p>
            <p>In the event that you're actively interested in strategically eliminating different kinds of pollutants
                while also eliminating a troublesome odor in your home, you'll be best served by investing in at least 2
                new air purifiers. This is because, you may need a charcoal air purifier to deal with an odor coming
                from your kitchen, while you'll also need a HEPA filter to thoroughly eliminate other pollutants like
                dust and pollen from a heavily frequented living space in your home like the dining room.</p>

                <h2>Dimensions</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The dimensions of a specific air purifier will be measured in Width", Depth", and Height". You will need
                to take measurements in the particular living space where you plan to place your air purifier to ensure
                that it will fit properly. There are small, medium, large, and whole-house air purifiers. Small air
                purifiers are generally best for personal spaces and any rooms up to 200 sq ft. Next, medium air
                purifiers are effective in rooms between 200-400 sq ft. Then, large air purifiers are great for rooms
                ranging between 400-1,500 sq ft. Last, whole-house air purifiers are best for sanitizing the air in
                every room of your house.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Modern air purifiers feature cutting-edge special features like an AUTO mode that includes a smart air
                quality sensor. This sensor can rapidly detect pollutants present in your air, and make real-time fan
                adjustments to optimize the air sanitation process. Plus, you’ll often have access to a digital display
                on the air purifier that shows your air quality level. Additionally, air purifiers with HEPA filters can
                include reset indicators that will flash and alert you when it’s time to replace the filter. There are
                also air purifiers with built-in warm night lights that feature easily customizable brightness levels,
                and a timer for the added convenience of an auto-shut-off capability. Air purifiers possess numerous
                high-tech functionalities that can greatly enhance their operational efficiency. Below are two of the
                main features worth considering when you're shopping for a new air purifier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ultra-Quiet: Many air purifiers will run as low as 25db (most homes never exceed this during the
                    day), and the special display light can auto-shutoff to help ensure you get an undisturbed night's
                    sleep. </li>
                <li>Smart View Air Quality Sensor: Some air purifiers contain a built-in sensor that will scan the
                    surrounding air for any pollutants, and then continuously update the display so that you can
                    actively monitor the state of your air quality. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By investing a bit more money in an air purifier that has additional special features like those that
                we've discussed, you’ll only stand to benefit that much more down the road from a low-maintenance and
                highly effective device. </p>

            </div>
            <h2>How much does it cost to run an air purifier?</h2>
            <p>Air purifiers are highly efficient in their electricity usage. They are designed such that their max
                wattage ranges anywhere from 40W to 200W, and that would be for the highest speed setting. As a helpful
                comparison, a fridge will use 3-5 times more energy on average. Most air purifiers that are available
                for purchase will only cost you max $7 a week due to their impressive energy efficiency.</p>
            <h2>How often do you need to change the filter in your air purifier?</h2>
            <p>You should make sure to replace your HEPA filter at least once a year, and sometimes more if it’s been
                exposed to a highly concentrated amount of particulates in the air. If you have an activated carbon
                filter, that will need to be replaced every 3-6 months. As previously mentioned, some air purifiers are
                filter-free and won't require you to invest in new filters. However, As mentioned some air purifiers
                like ultraviolet air purifiers and air ionizers don't use a filter to purify and may be worth
                considering if you don't want to bother with replacing filters down the road. </p>
            <h2>How frequently should you run your air purifier?</h2>
            <p>While the amount of time that an air purifier will take to improve the air quality of a given room
                varies, in general, you should run your air purifier at least a few hours per day. You’ll want to make
                sure to run your air purifier at least once per day to ensure that you benefit most from it. You could
                also run your air purifier 24/7 but should note that this will use more power, and you may need to
                replace and/or clean the air purifier’s filters more often. </p>
